In this survey, we summarize over 500 high-quality papers published in top conferences or journals over the past 5 years including but not limited to ICML, NeurIPS, ICLR, KDD, WWW, TPAMI, etc. 
To catch up with the frontiers, some latest works on OpenReview and Arxiv are also included. In the above we summarizes the statistics of the collected papers. 
We see that the number of papers released about heterophily graph learning has significantly increased in recent three years. Meanwhile, the distribution of collected papers published in major venues is given above. 
Further, we present the Top-10 keywords that appear in the titles of collected papers.
